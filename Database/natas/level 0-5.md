Natas walkthrough

# level 0-1

---

empty webpage with a button. button is listed as a moveable object. tried moving it to see if anything was under its location. after learning that ther wasnt anything there, inspected the source code for the button itself. password was hidden inside the buttons source code.

---

# level 1-2

---

this level didnt allow for you to be able to right click. you had to open the page inspection and then make your way over to the button, view the source code for the button, and then you would find the password.

---

# level 2-3

---

there isnt anything on the page and the button is no longer the source of the password. there IS an image on the site. they use a PNG file the period at the end of the
` there is nothing on this page`
this leads me to belive that the password is hidden in the image. i have viewed the source code for that image and found nothing. if this was much higher levels, i would think maybe some stegonography but i doubt there is a substantial jump in diffuclty.
